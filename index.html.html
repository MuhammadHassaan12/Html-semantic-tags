   <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
   <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p><del>Molly</del><ins>Hassaan</ins> had been starting out her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <cite>Nature, New Scientist</cite>, and all about the <s>otherscientific journals</s> her work 
       had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>.It had been molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed 
       to be free.</p>
    <p>she had spent the last ten years in this room, Sitting under a poster with an <strong>Oscar Wide</strong> quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better 
       to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama  <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievment, 
       Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.</p>
